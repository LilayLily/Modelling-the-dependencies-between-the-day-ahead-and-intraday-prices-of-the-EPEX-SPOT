# Modelling-the-dependencies-between-the-day-ahead-and-intraday-prices-of-the-EPEX-SPOT

According to the German government's energy concept, 80 % of total electricity consumption is to be covered by electricity generation from renewable energies (RE) by the end of 2050. Authors such as Becker et al. (2014) point out that this target can be achieved by increasing electricity generation from intermittent RES such as wind and solar energy.

The day-ahead market is of enormous importance for the integration of intermittent RE into the German electricity market. Here, the market participants can market the forecast wind and solar energy output one day before the electricity delivery. Discrepancies detected at short notice between the previous day's forecast and the intraday forecast can be compensated for on the intraday market until immediately before the delivery of electricity. Furthermore, forecast inaccuracies lead to regular price fluctuations on the intraday market.

The overall objective motivating this work is to empirically investigate the dynamic behavior of intraday prices. For this purpose, a model is designed that depicts the relationship between day-ahead and intraday prices on the German electricity market. Within this correlation, further relevant factors are to be identified and taken into account in addition to the forecast errors of wind and solar power output.
